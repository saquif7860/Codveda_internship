# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Prediction

This project is part of my Data Analysis Internship at Codveda Technologies. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using the famous Iris dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The Iris dataset contains the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The objective is to predict the correct species of a flower based on its measurements.
